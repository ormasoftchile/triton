# Decision: Diagram-Options Reference Format

**Author:** Leslie (Lead / Spec Architect)  
**Date:** 2026-07-06  
**Status:** READY — downstream agents must implement exactly as specified below  
**Requested by:** ormasoftchile  

---

## Context

The user needs a quick, convenient way to see the OPTIONS available for each diagram type.
We are delivering two artifacts:

1. **`docs/diagram-options.md`** — a single central markdown reference concatenated from per-family fragments.
2. **`%%` comment header blocks** at the top of each example `.mmd` file — visible to anyone opening the file.

The flowchart family has been implemented as the verified exemplar. All downstream agents must follow this specification exactly and point at the exemplar before starting.

**Exemplar files (READ THESE FIRST):**
- Fragment: `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/flowchart.md`
- Example with header: `examples/mermaid/flowchart/flowchart.mmd`

---

## Part 1 — Fragment Template

Each agent writes one file per family to `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/<family>.md`.
The file MUST follow this verbatim template structure (section headings, table format, snippet fence):

```markdown
## <Family name, title-case>

<One sentence: what this diagram type draws. Derived from grammar.peggy file header comment.>

**Header keyword(s):** `<token1>` · `<token2>`

---

### <Category A heading — use only categories that apply>

| <col1> | <col2> |
|--------|--------|
| ...    | ...    |

---

### <Category B heading>

...

---

### Minimal snippet

```
<diagram header>
  <2–4 lines showing the most common syntax>
```
```

**Mandatory sections** (include all that the grammar supports; omit those it doesn't):

| Section heading      | When to include                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Directions           | Grammar has a Direction rule                        |
| Node shapes          | Grammar defines multiple shape variants             |
| Edge types           | Grammar has multiple EdgeArrow/RelOp variants       |
| Relationship types   | For ER, class, requirement, C4 — relation keywords  |
| Entry / Event syntax | For timeline, journey, gantt — per-entry syntax     |
| Block keywords       | subgraph, section, group, etc.                      |
| Config keywords      | Grammar-level directives (title, tickInterval, etc.)|
| Overlays             | note, legend (shared overlay directives)            |
| Directives           | style, classDef, click — captured-not-interpreted   |
| Frontmatter          | Only if grammar has Frontmatter rule                |
| Comments             | ONLY if grammar has `%%` Comment rule (see Part 3)  |
| Minimal snippet      | ALWAYS required                                     |

**Table format rules:**
- Use `·` (middle dot U+00B7) to separate alternatives on a single cell.
- Literal syntax tokens go in backticks.
- Keep table rows to a single line; wrap into a second row only if > 120 chars.
- No lorem-ipsum descriptions — every cell is derived from the grammar source.

**Source discipline:** Every option listed MUST exist in the family's `grammar.peggy` (or its `index.ts` hand-parser). If uncertain, grep the grammar. Do NOT invent options.

---

## Part 2 — Example `%%` Header Convention

### Format (verbatim)

The `%%` header block is inserted AFTER the diagram's first line (the header keyword line)
and BEFORE any content lines. Every line MUST start with `%%`.

```
<header keyword> <direction or first token>
%% ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
%% <FAMILY NAME UPPER-CASE> — options quick-ref
%% ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
%% Header:      <keyword1> | <keyword2>
%% <Category>:  <value1> · <value2> · <value3>
%% <Category>:  <value1> · <value2>
%% ...
%% ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  <first content line of the diagram>
```

**Rules:**
- Separator line is exactly 76 `─` characters (U+2500) after `%% `.
- Category labels are right-padded with spaces so colons align (use 13-char label field).
- Summarise options compactly — one line per category. If a category's values overflow 78 chars, wrap to a second `%%` line with the same indentation.
- Copy the block verbatim across all `.mmd` files in the same family directory — do not customise per file.
- The block is purely informational: it must NOT alter the rendered SVG in any way other than trivial re-render noise (e.g., background rect coordinate style).

### Verified exemplar

See `examples/mermaid/flowchart/flowchart.mmd` for the canonical reference.
Confirmed: `node scripts/preview.mjs examples/mermaid/flowchart/` exits 0, all 3 SVGs regenerate, diagram layout is unchanged.

---

## Part 3 — Comment Safety Detection Rule

### Detection method

Before adding ANY `%%` header, the agent MUST check whether the family's grammar supports `%%` comments:

```bash
grep -c '%%' src/diagrams/<mermaid|triton>/<family>/grammar.peggy
```

- Output **> 0**: `%%` is supported — proceed with header insertion.
- Output **0** (or grammar.peggy does not exist): `%%` is NOT supported — see fallback below.

For families with a hand-written parser (`index.ts`) and no `grammar.peggy`, grep the `index.ts` instead:

```bash
grep -c '%%' src/diagrams/<mermaid|triton>/<family>/index.ts
```

### Families confirmed to support `%%` (as of 2026-07-06)

| Family      | Location             | `%%` in grammar |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| flowchart   | mermaid/flowchart    | ✓ YES           |
| sankey      | mermaid/sankey       | ✓ YES           |
| timeline    | mermaid/timeline     | ✓ YES           |
| poster      | triton/poster        | ✓ YES           |

All other 18+ families currently have NO `%%` rule in their grammar — confirmed by grep.

### Fallback for families WITHOUT `%%` support

1. **Do NOT add** the `%%` header block to any `.mmd` example files for that family.
2. **Do add** the following note to the family's fragment, at the bottom BEFORE the "Minimal snippet" section:

```markdown
> **Note:** This grammar does not define a `%%` comment rule. Inline options-comments
> are not supported for this family's example files — see `docs/diagram-options.md`
> for the full options reference.
```

3. The "Comments" section is **omitted** from the fragment for that family.

---

## Part 4 — Commands

All commands are run from the repo root (`/Users/cristianormazabal/Projects/triton`).

| Step | Command | Pass condition |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Build grammars only | `node scripts/build-grammars.mjs` | Exits 0, 23 grammars compiled |
| Full build | `pnpm build` | Exits 0 |
| Render one example dir | `node scripts/preview.mjs examples/<path>/` | Exits 0, prints `✓ <name>.svg` for each file |
| Type check | `pnpm typecheck` | Exits 0, 0 errors |
| Verify SVG unchanged (layout) | `git diff --stat examples/<path>/*.svg` | 0 additions/deletions OR only trivial 2-line background rect changes |

**After adding `%%` headers to a family's examples, the agent MUST:**
1. Run `node scripts/preview.mjs examples/<mermaid|triton>/<family>/`
2. Confirm exit code 0 and `✓ <name>.svg` for every file.
3. If any file errors: remove the header block from that file, note the failure in the fragment (same fallback note as Part 3).

---

## Part 5 — Family Groups and Assignment

Agents are assigned families by group. Each group writes its fragments to
`docs/diagram-options/_fragments/<family>.md`.

**Group A** — class, state, er, c4, requirement  
**Group B** — sequence, timeline, journey, gantt, gitgraph, kanban  
**Group C** — pie, xychart, quadrant, radar, sankey, mindmap  
**Group D** — architecture, block, packet, topology, poster  
**Group E** — all `ds` subkinds: array, linkedlist, memory, page, tree, plan, avl, rbtree, btree, radix, segtree, heap, queue, cqueue, deque, pqueue, stack, hashmap, matrix, trie, nodegraph, unionfind

**flowchart** is DONE — do not reassign.

### Fragment filename convention

- Mermaid families: `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/<family>.md`  
  e.g., `class.md`, `state.md`, `er.md`
- Triton families: `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-<family>.md`  
  e.g., `triton-architecture.md`, `triton-block.md`
- DS subkinds: `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/ds-<subkind>.md`  
  e.g., `ds-array.md`, `ds-trie.md`

### Concatenation (done last, by Leslie or orchestrator)

Once all fragments are written:
```bash
cat docs/diagram-options/_fragments/*.md > docs/diagram-options.md
```
Order: flowchart first, then groups A–E alphabetically within each group.

---

## Part 6 — Grammar Source Locations

All grammar files follow the pattern:
- `src/diagrams/mermaid/<family>/grammar.peggy` (18 Mermaid families)
- `src/diagrams/triton/<family>/grammar.peggy` (Triton families with PEG grammar)
- `src/diagrams/ds/<subkind>/index.ts` (DS subkinds — hand-written parsers, no .peggy)
- `src/diagrams/triton/ds/` may also have hand-parsers per subkind

Examples live under:
- `examples/mermaid/<family>/` for Mermaid families
- `examples/triton/<family>/` for Triton families  
- `examples/ds/<subkind>/` for DS subkinds

---

## Decisions recorded

1. **Fragment-first, concat-last** — per-family fragments avoid merge conflicts when 5 agents run in parallel.
2. **`%%` only after header keyword line** — the flowchart grammar's `BlankLine = _ Comment? NL` rule only matches within `Statements` (after the header), not before it. All verified-supporting grammars follow the same pattern.
3. **Comment safety is per-grammar, not global** — agents must grep each grammar individually. 14 of 18 Mermaid grammars currently have NO `%%` rule.
4. **SVG noise is acceptable** — trivial background-rect style changes (2 lines) are not a regression. What matters is exit 0 and layout/content identity.
5. **Options are grammar-derived only** — no invented syntax. If a feature isn't in the grammar, it isn't listed.

# Decision Record: Diagram-Options Reference Assembled

**Author:** Leslie (Lead / Spec Architect)  
**Date:** 2026-07-06  
**Status:** Done

---

## Summary

All 45 diagram-family option fragments were assembled into the final central reference document and the full test suite verified clean.

---

## Final Artifact Paths

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Central reference doc | `docs/diagram-options.md` |
| Fragment directory | `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/` (45 `.md` files) |
| Format spec | `.squad/decisions/inbox/leslie-diagram-options-format.md` |

---

## Document Structure

`docs/diagram-options.md` contains 45 family sections in three groups:

1. **Mermaid Diagrams (18)** — flowchart first, then c4 · class · er · gantt · gitgraph · journey · kanban · mindmap · pie · quadrant · radar · requirement · sankey · sequence · state · timeline · xychart
2. **Triton Diagrams (5)** — architecture · block · packet · poster · topology
3. **Data-Structure / DS Diagrams (22)** — array · avl · btree · cqueue · deque · hashmap · heap · linkedlist · matrix · memory · nodegraph · page · plan · pqueue · queue · radix · rbtree · segtree · stack · tree · trie · unionfind

---

## Families with Inline `%%` Example Headers

The following four families have parsers that strip `%%` comment lines before evaluation. Their example `.mmd` files carry a `%%`-prefixed options block at the top of each file, making the available syntax visible alongside the diagram source:

| Family | Example files with inline header |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| `flowchart` | `ci-pipeline.mmd`, `flowchart.mmd`, `order-processing.mmd` |
| `sankey` | `sankey.mmd` |
| `timeline` | `ai-timeline.mmd`, `company-history.mmd`, `customer-journey.mmd`, `our-timeline.mmd`, `product-roadmap.mmd`, `release-roadmap.mmd`, `sections.mmd`, `timeline.mmd`, `vertical-journey.mmd` |
| `poster` | `ds-poster.mmd`, `engineering-dashboard.mmd`, `launch-readiness.mmd`, `poster.mmd`, `row-spanning.mmd`, `spanning.mmd`, `sql-engine.mmd` |

All other families carry a fallback note in their fragment explaining that `%%` headers are not supported and referring readers to `docs/diagram-options.md`.

---

## Test Result

`pnpm test` (from repo root, 2026-07-06):

```
Test Files  30 passed (30)
     Tests  384 passed (384)
  Duration  3.94s
```

**Result: PASS.** No `%%` header broke any family's render. The 69-example corpus in `test/examples.test.ts` rendered cleanly.

---

## Unexpected Git Changes

Two untracked files appeared that are not part of this deliverable:

- `fix_poster_headers.py` — scratch script left by a sub-agent; not committed.
- `examples/triton/ds/array/array.svg` — new untracked SVG render; not committed.

Neither affects the test corpus or the assembled reference doc.

# Decision: Diagram-Options Group A — class, state, er, c4, requirement

**Author:** Bjarne (Ingestion Design)  
**Date:** 2026-07-06  
**Status:** DONE — all 5 fragments written; no `%%` headers added  

---

## Summary

Five grammar-derived option fragments have been written for Group A families,
following Leslie's spec (`leslie-diagram-options-format.md`) and the flowchart exemplar.

Fragment paths:
- `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/class.md`
- `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/state.md`
- `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/er.md`
- `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/c4.md`
- `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/requirement.md`

---

## Per-family `%%` comment support

| Family      | Grammar path                                    | `%%` count | Headers added | Fallback note |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| class       | `src/diagrams/mermaid/class/grammar.peggy`      | 0          | NO            | YES           |
| state       | `src/diagrams/mermaid/state/grammar.peggy`      | 0          | NO            | YES           |
| er          | `src/diagrams/mermaid/er/grammar.peggy`         | 0          | NO            | YES           |
| c4          | `src/diagrams/mermaid/c4/grammar.peggy`         | 0          | NO            | YES           |
| requirement | `src/diagrams/mermaid/requirement/grammar.peggy`| 0          | NO            | YES           |

All five Group A families lack a `%%` Comment rule. No example `.mmd` files were
modified. All five fragments include the fallback note and omit the Comments section.
Preview (`node scripts/preview.mjs`) was not run — no headers to validate.

---

## Families that needed the fallback

All five: **class, state, er, c4, requirement**.

---

## Key grammar notes

- **class**: 14 RelTok alternatives; cardinality via quoted strings; `note` accepted-discarded;
  no direction rule.
- **state**: Single `-->` transition arrow; `<<choice|fork|join>>` pseudo-states; `direction`
  accepted by DirectiveLine but discarded (not applied by Triton layout).
- **er**: Crow's-foot ErTok pattern `[|}{o][|}{o](--|..)[|}{o][|}{o]`; attribute keys PK/FK/UK;
  label required on every relation.
- **c4**: 5 header variants; `kindOf()` maps freeform NodeKind identifiers to 8 IR kinds;
  4 boundary types; 3 relation keywords (Rel/Rel_Ext/BiRel).
- **requirement**: 7 ReqKind alternatives (case-insensitive); NO Frontmatter rule (unique in
  Group A); relationship type is unconstrained Ident (conventional: satisfies/contains/refines/derives).

# Decision: Group B Diagram-Options — Comment Support and Fallbacks

**Author:** David (Research Lead)
**Date:** 2026-07-06
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Families:** sequence, timeline, journey, gantt, gitgraph, kanban

---

## Summary

Fragment files have been written for all 6 Group B families under
`docs/diagram-options/_fragments/<family>.md`. All options are grammar-derived
(sources: `src/diagrams/mermaid/<family>/grammar.peggy` and, for gantt, also
`src/diagrams/mermaid/gantt/index.ts`).

---

## Per-Family `%%` Comment Support

### `grep -c '%%' src/diagrams/mermaid/<family>/grammar.peggy` results

| Family   | Count | `%%` supported? | Action taken                                  |
|----------|-------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| sequence | 0     | ✗ NO            | Fallback note added to fragment; no headers   |
| timeline | 1     | ✓ YES           | Headers added to all 9 `.mmd` examples (see constraint below) |
| journey  | 0     | ✗ NO            | Fallback note added to fragment; no headers   |
| gantt    | 0     | ✗ NO            | Fallback note added to fragment; no headers   |
| gitgraph | 0     | ✗ NO            | Fallback note added to fragment; no headers   |
| kanban   | 0     | ✗ NO            | Fallback note added to fragment; no headers   |

---

## Timeline `%%` Placement Constraint (NEW FINDING)

**Finding:** Although timeline's grammar defines `Comment = "%%" [^\n]*`, this
rule is only reachable via `BlankLine = _ Comment? NL` inside the `Body`
alternative. The grammar's `Document` rule is:

```
Document = ExtFrontmatter? _ Header _ Directive* _ Body _
```

`Directive*` matches `title`, `subtitle`, `theme`, `layout`, `axisUnit` before
`Body` begins. Inserting `%%` lines between the `timeline` keyword and the
directive lines causes a parse error because `%%` is not a valid token in the
`Directive*` context.

**Rule for timeline `%%` headers:**
> `%%` comment lines MUST appear after all directive lines and before the first
> Body item (section / entry). Placing them immediately after `timeline\n`
> (as the spec's flowchart model suggests) causes a PARSE_ERROR.

**Verification:** After repositioning the header block to after the last
directive in each of the 9 timeline example files, `node scripts/preview.mjs
examples/mermaid/timeline/` exited 0 with `✓ <name>.svg` for all 9 files.

**Recommendation for spec update:** Leslie's Part 2 placement rule ("after the
diagram's first line") should be annotated with a grammar-class exception: for
families whose grammars have `Directive*` between the header keyword and the
body, `%%` headers belong after the last directive, not after the keyword line.

---

## Fallback Note Text (applied to all families with no `%%` support)

```markdown
> **Note:** This grammar does not define a `%%` comment rule. Inline options-comments
> are not supported for this family's example files — see `docs/diagram-options.md`
> for the full options reference.
```

Applied to: `sequence.md`, `journey.md`, `gantt.md`, `gitgraph.md`, `kanban.md`.

## Fragment File Inventory

| Fragment path                                         | `%%` headers in examples? | Preview |

---

## Key Grammar Findings (source discipline)

**sequence** (`grammar.peggy`):
- Arrow rule (8 variants): `->>`, `-->>` (solid/dashed arrow); `->`, `-->` (open); `-x`, `--x` (cross); `-)`, `--)` (async).
- Activation inline: `+` activates target, `-` deactivates source (suffix on arrow).
- Note placements: `over`, `left of`, `right of`.
- Fragments: `alt` (else), `opt`, `loop`, `par` (and), `critical`, `break` — all closed with `end`.
- Explicit `activate`/`deactivate` statements: parsed but return `{ t: 'ignore' }` — no effect.

**timeline** (`grammar.peggy`):
- L1 directives (Mermaid): `title`, `subtitle`, `theme`.
- L2 directives (Triton ext): `layout`, `axisUnit`.
- L1 entry: `date : Event text`.
- L2 range: `start -- end : Label : status @track | desc`.
- L2 point: `date : Label : milestone|active|done|blocked @track | desc`.
- Statuses: `active`, `done`, `blocked`, `default`.

**journey** (`grammar.peggy`):
- Task: `label : score : Actor1, Actor2`. Score is numeric; grammar pattern: `"-"? [0-9]+ ("." [0-9]+)?`.
- No frontmatter, no `%%`.

**gantt** (`grammar.peggy` + `index.ts`):
- `ExcludesLine` accepts: `excludes`, `axisFormat`, `todayMarker`, `tickInterval` — parsed, returned null.
- Task meta resolved by `index.ts`: `STATUS_FLAGS = new Set(['done','active','crit','milestone'])`.
- `after id` dependency: `re.test(startTok, /^after\s+/i)`.
- Duration: regex `(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*([dwhm]?)` — `d`/`w`/`h` have explicit cases.

**gitgraph** (`grammar.peggy`):
- No `cherry-pick` statement — not in grammar.
- `switch` is a grammar-level alias for `checkout`.
- `order: N` on `branch` is parsed but value not captured in IR.
- `Opt` rule covers `id`/`tag`/`type` for both `commit` and `merge`.

**kanban** (`grammar.peggy`):
- Column: any unindented text line (`$[^\n]+`).
- Card: `id?` (`$[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`) + `"[" text:$[^\]\n]+ "]"`.
- No priorities, assignees, metadata — grammar only tracks `id` and `text`.

# Decision: Group C Diagram Options — Comment Support & Fragment Summary

**Author:** Mark (IR & Data Modeling)  
**Date:** 2026-07-06  
**Status:** DONE — all 6 Group C fragments written; sankey `%%` header verified

---

## Summary

Per-family `%%` comment support and fragment delivery for Group C: pie, xychart, quadrant, radar, sankey, mindmap.

---

## Per-family findings

| Family    | `%%` in grammar.peggy | Action                             | Preview result         | Fragment path                                          |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| pie       | 0 — NOT supported    | No header; fallback note added     | n/a (no header)        | `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/pie.md`               |
| xychart   | 0 — NOT supported    | No header; fallback note added     | n/a (no header)        | `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/xychart.md`           |
| quadrant  | 0 — NOT supported    | No header; fallback note added     | n/a (no header)        | `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/quadrant.md`          |
| radar     | 0 — NOT supported    | No header; fallback note added     | n/a (no header)        | `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/radar.md`             |
| sankey    | 2 — SUPPORTED        | Header block added to sankey.mmd   | exit 0 · sankey.svg ✓  | `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/sankey.md`            |
| mindmap   | 0 — NOT supported    | No header; fallback note added     | n/a (no header)        | `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/mindmap.md`           |

---

## Fallback note (applied to pie, xychart, quadrant, radar, mindmap)

Each fragment without `%%` support carries this note (per Leslie's Part 3 spec) above the Minimal snippet section:

> **Note:** This grammar does not define a `%%` comment rule. Inline options-comments
> are not supported for this family's example files — see `docs/diagram-options.md`
> for the full options reference.

---

## Sankey `%%` header block

Inserted after `sankey-beta` (header keyword line) in `examples/mermaid/sankey/sankey.mmd`:

```
sankey-beta
%% ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
%% SANKEY — options quick-ref
%% ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
%% Header:      sankey-beta
%% Links:       Source,Target,Value  (one CSV row per link)
%% Comments:    %% text  (stripped before parse)
%% ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Verified: `node scripts/preview.mjs examples/mermaid/sankey/` → exit 0, `✓ sankey.svg`.

---

## Key grammar facts (options-catalogue)

- **pie**: `showData` flag + `title <text>` both on header line; slices as `"Label" : <num>` rows.
- **xychart**: Header `xychart-beta [horizontal|vertical]`; `title`, `x-axis [cats]`, `y-axis "label" min --> max`; series `bar [v,…]` and `line [v,…]`.
- **quadrant**: `quadrantChart`; `title`, `x-axis left --> right`, `y-axis bottom --> top`, `quadrant-1..4 label`; points `Label: [x, y]` (x,y ∈ 0–1).
- **radar**: `radar-beta`; `title`, `max`, `min`; `axis id["Label"],…`; `curve id["Label"]{v,…}`.
- **sankey**: `sankey-beta`; CSV rows `Source,Target,Value`; `%%` comments stripped by grammar.
- **mindmap**: `mindmap`; YAML frontmatter; indentation = hierarchy depth; shape wrappers `((…))` `(…)` `[…]` `{{…}}` stripped by `index.ts:cleanLabel`; `::icon(name)` directive attaches icon to preceding node.

# Decision: Group D Diagram-Options — Comment Support & Fallbacks

**Author:** Brian (Layout Implementation Engineer)  
**Date:** 2026-07-06  
**Status:** COMPLETE  

---

## Summary

All five Group D (Triton) families have been processed: fragments written, `%%` support
verified per grammar, headers added where safe, previews confirmed.

---

## Per-Family Results

### architecture

- **Source:** `src/diagrams/triton/architecture/grammar.peggy`
- **`%%` count:** 0 — NOT supported
- **Action:** No `%%` header added to `examples/triton/architecture/` files.
- **Fallback note:** Added to `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-architecture.md` before Minimal snippet.
- **Fragment:** `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-architecture.md` ✓

### block

- **Source:** `src/diagrams/triton/block/grammar.peggy`
- **`%%` count:** 0 — NOT supported
- **Action:** No `%%` header added to `examples/triton/block/` files.
- **Fallback note:** Added to `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-block.md` before Minimal snippet.
- **Fragment:** `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-block.md` ✓

### packet

- **Source:** `src/diagrams/triton/packet/grammar.peggy`
- **`%%` count:** 0 — NOT supported
- **Action:** No `%%` header added to `examples/triton/packet/` files.
- **Fallback note:** Added to `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-packet.md` before Minimal snippet.
- **Fragment:** `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-packet.md` ✓

### topology

- **Source:** No `grammar.peggy`; hand-parser `src/diagrams/triton/topology/topology.ts`
- **`%%` count (in topology.ts):** 0 — NOT supported
- **Action:** No `%%` header added to `examples/triton/topology/` files.
- **Fallback note:** Added to `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-topology.md` before Minimal snippet.
- **Fragment:** `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-topology.md` ✓

### poster

- **Source:** `src/diagrams/triton/poster/grammar.peggy`
- **`%%` count:** 1 — SUPPORTED
- **Action:** `%%` header block added to all 7 `.mmd` files in `examples/triton/poster/`.
- **Placement quirk:** The poster grammar parses `%%` comments only within `BodyItems`
  (via `BlankLine = _ Comment? NL`). The `GridDirective*` phase (between `poster "Title"` and
  the first `cell`) does NOT allow comments. Inserting the block immediately after the
  `poster` keyword line causes a PARSE_ERROR. **Correct placement: after the `columns N`
  (or last grid directive) line and before the first `cell` block.**
- **Preview:** `node scripts/preview.mjs examples/triton/poster/` → exit 0, all 7 SVGs ✓
  (`ds-poster.svg`, `engineering-dashboard.svg`, `launch-readiness.svg`, `poster.svg`,
  `row-spanning.svg`, `spanning.svg`, `sql-engine.svg`)
- **Fragment:** `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-poster.md` ✓ (includes Comments section)

---

## Fragments Written

| Fragment path | Family | Comments section |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-architecture.md` | architecture | omitted (no `%%`) |
| `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-block.md` | block | omitted (no `%%`) |
| `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-packet.md` | packet | omitted (no `%%`) |
| `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-topology.md` | topology | omitted (no `%%`) |
| `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/triton-poster.md` | poster | ✓ included |

---

## Notes for Orchestrator / Leslie

1. **poster `%%` placement rule is non-standard.** For all other grammars that support `%%`,
   the comment rule is available immediately after the header keyword line. For poster, it is
   only available in `BodyItems` (after grid directives). This is a grammar-level constraint;
   fixing it would require adding a `BlankLine` alternative to the `GridDirective*` loop.

2. **topology has no grammar.peggy.** It is fully hand-parsed in `topology.ts`. No Peggy
   compilation step for this family.

3. **architecture indentation-based group membership.** Services indented under a `group` line
   are implicitly assigned to that group (via `indent > curIndent && curGroup` in the action),
   in addition to the explicit `in <group>` syntax. Both are grammar-supported.

# Decision: Group E — DS Diagram-Options Fragments

**Author:** Edsger (Layout Algorithms)  
**Date:** 2026-07-06  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Task:** Write `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/ds-<subkind>.md` for all ds subkinds per Leslie's spec.

---

## Full subkind list (22 subkinds)

Source layout under `src/diagrams/triton/ds/`:

| Subkind | Source file | Header keyword(s) | Has examples |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| array | `struct/array.ts` | `array` | ✓ |
| linkedlist | `struct/linkedlist.ts` | `linkedlist` | — |
| memory | `struct/memory.ts` | `memory` | — |
| page | `struct/page.ts` | `page` | — |
| queue | `queue/queue.ts` | `queue` | ✓ |
| cqueue | `queue/cqueue.ts` | `cqueue` | ✓ |
| deque | `queue/deque.ts` | `deque` | ✓ |
| pqueue | `queue/pqueue.ts` | `pqueue` | ✓ |
| stack | `stack/stack.ts` | `stack` | ✓ |

| unionfind | `unionfind/unionfind.ts` | `unionfind` · `dsu` | ✓ |
| nodegraph | `graph/graph.ts` | `nodegraph` · `dsgraph` | ✓ |
| tree | `tree/index.ts` (grammar.peggy) | `tree` | ✓ |
| plan | `tree/plan.ts` (grammar.peggy) | `plan` | ✓ |
| avl | `tree/avl.ts` | `avl` | ✓ |
| rbtree | `tree/rbtree.ts` | `rbtree` | ✓ |

## `%%` comment support: ALL use fallback

**Detection method:** `grep -c '%%' <parser-file>` for every subkind.

**Result:**

| Check | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| All hand-written parsers (`struct/`, `queue/`, `stack/`, `hashmap/`, `matrix/`, `trie/`, `unionfind/`, `graph/`) | 0 occurrences — use shared `lines()` helper which does NOT filter `%%` |
| `tree/grammar.peggy` (used by `tree` and `plan`) | 0 occurrences — no `%%` comment rule |

**All 22 subkinds: NO `%%` support.** No `%%` header blocks were added to any `.mmd` example files.

---

## Fallback note (applied to all 22 fragments)

All fragments include:

> **Note:** This grammar does not define a `%%` comment rule. Inline options-comments
> are not supported for this family's example files — see `docs/diagram-options.md`
> for the full options reference.

The "Comments" section is omitted from all ds fragments.

---

## Fragment files written

All 22 fragments written to `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/`:

```
ds-array.md
ds-linkedlist.md
ds-memory.md
ds-page.md
ds-queue.md
ds-cqueue.md
ds-deque.md
ds-pqueue.md
ds-stack.md

## Render verification

Command: `node scripts/preview.mjs examples/triton/ds/<subkind>/` for each example directory.

| Directory | Files rendered | Exit code |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| `ds/array/` | array.svg | 0 ✓ |
| `ds/graph/` | graph.svg | 0 ✓ |
| `ds/hashmap/` | hashmap.svg | 0 ✓ |
| `ds/matrix/` | matrix.svg | 0 ✓ |
| `ds/queue/` | circular.svg · deque.svg · linear.svg · priority.svg | 0 ✓ |
| `ds/stack/` | stack.svg | 0 ✓ |
| `ds/trie/` | trie.svg | 0 ✓ |
| `ds/unionfind/` | unionfind.svg | 0 ✓ |
| `ds/tree/` | avl.svg · btree.svg · decision.svg · heap.svg · plan.svg · query-plan.svg · radix.svg · rbtree.svg · segtree.svg | 0 ✓ |

**Total: 21 SVGs regenerated, all exit 0.** No `.mmd` files were modified (no `%%` headers added), so SVG layout is unchanged from baseline.

---

## Notes

- The `preview.mjs` script does NOT recursively walk `examples/triton/ds/` — it must be invoked per subkind directory. Running it at `examples/triton/ds/` gives "No .mmd files found".
- Three subkinds have no example files: `linkedlist`, `memory`, `page`. Their fragments were derived entirely from parser source (`struct/linkedlist.ts`, `struct/memory.ts`, `struct/page.ts`).
- The tree family's `grammar.peggy` is the only `.peggy` file among ds subkinds (all others are pure hand-written `.ts` parsers).
