## Learnings

- 2026-07-13T12:14:32.683-07:00 — `src/diagrams/triton/ds/hashmap/hashmap.ts` now normalizes `bucketLabels` for both Mermaid and YAML inputs, supports `bucket <label>:` plus quoted labels, and keeps anchors positional (`b0`, `b0e0`) for backward compatibility while rendering string labels in the bucket column.
- 2026-07-13T12:14:32.683-07:00 — Hashmap docs/examples live in `docs/diagram-options.md`, `docs/diagram-options/_fragments/ds-hashmap.md`, and `examples/triton/ds/hashmap/hashmap.mmd`; hashmap behavior is regression-covered in `test/ds-b1.test.ts` and editor help in `extension/src/keywords.ts`.

## Learnings — 2026-07-13 Phase C: directional grid placer

### Algorithm implemented

**BFS direction-constrained grid placement** — Mermaid's Phase 1 algorithm (architectureDb.ts:217–275), adapted to Triton's IR.

**Files created/modified:**
- `src/diagrams/mermaid/architecture/gridPlacer.ts` — BFS grid placer (~120 LOC)
- `src/diagrams/mermaid/architecture/layout.ts` — swapped `layeredLayout` for `directionalGridPlacer`
- `test/gridPlacer.test.ts` — 23 new tests including canonical 2×2 grid fixture

**Key delta table (CORRECTED from Edsger's spec):**
- LR: (-1,0), RL: (+1,0)
- TB: (0,-1), BT: (0,+1)  ← spec had these SWAPPED; BT=(0,+1) places neighbor SOUTH (rows increase downward)
- Diagonals: LT=TL=(-1,-1), LB=BL=(-1,+1), RT=TR=(+1,-1), RB=BR=(+1,+1)

**Canonical grid expectation (db:L--R:server; disk1:T--B:server; disk2:T--B:db):**
- server (0,0) — top-left
- db (1,0) — top-right
- disk1 (0,1) — bottom-left
- disk2 (1,1) — bottom-right

**Align directives** remain as post-BFS median-snap (spec allows this for disconnected nodes / user overrides). Edge directions take precedence.

**Test count:** 853 tests (45 files), all green.



### What was implemented

**Feature 1 — Junctions** (`ArchJunction`, `ir.junctions[]`):
- Added junction IDs (16×16 px) to `GraphNode[]` alongside services so the layered layout engine positions them.
- Rendered as a filled 4px circle plus a 2-line crosshair path at the node center.
- Edges to/from junctions use the same side-anchored port logic as services.
- Entry point: junction node loop near line ~267 in `layout.ts`.

**Feature 2 — Arrowheads** (`arrowLeft` / `arrowRight`):
- Created two separate `<marker>` defs: `arch-arrow-end` (orient="auto") and `arch-arrow-start` (orient="auto-start-reverse").
- `arrowRight=true` → `markerEnd: ARROW_END_ID`; `arrowLeft=true` → `markerStart: ARROW_START_ID`.
- `--` = no markers; `-->` = end only; `<--` = start only; `<-->` = both.
- Entry point: edge loop, `pathOpts` construction, ~lines 228–231.

**Feature 3 — {group} modifier** (`fromGroup` / `toGroup`):
- When `fromGroup=true`, look up the service's `group`, compute `computeGroupRect`, and use that rect's port instead of the service's box.
- Same for `toGroup`. Falls back gracefully if the service has no group.
- Entry point: edge loop, ~lines 196–220.

**Feature 4 — Align constraints** (`ir.aligns[]`):
- Post-layout pass: after `layeredLayout`, copy positions into a mutable `Map<string, {x,y}>`.
- For each `ArchAlign`, snap all members to the median coordinate on the align axis (`row` → median y; `column` → median x).
- **APPROXIMATION**: constraints are median-snapped only; they don't feed back into crossing-minimisation or layer assignment. Overlaps can occur when align constraints conflict with the topology-driven layout (see defect in `align-grid.png`).
- Entry point: align loop, ~lines 102–131.

**Feature 5 — Nested groups** (`ArchGroup.parent`):
- `computeGroupRect(gId)` recursively includes child groups' rects (groups whose `parent === gId`).
- Memoised in `groupRectCache`.
- Groups rendered in topological order (parent before child = outer before inner, so child renders on top).
- ViewBox expanded to accommodate negative y when outer group labels extend above the layout margin.
- Entry point: `groupsByDepth()`, `computeGroupRect()`, group render loop.

**Feature 6 — Iconify icons** (`prefix:name` tokens):
- `resolveIconElems()`: if `icon` contains a colon, parse with `parseIconRef` + `resolveIcon`. On success, call `pen.icon()` (24×24 centered box). On failure, fall back to built-in glyph + `console.warn` once per token.
- Requires `LayoutOptions.icons` (populated by host layer). Without it, icons fall back silently.
- `index.ts` updated to forward `options?: LayoutOptions` to `layoutArchitecture`.

### Key entry points in `layout.ts`
- `layoutArchitecture(ir, theme, options?)` — main function
- `computeGroupRect(gId)` — recursive memoised group rect, ~line 155
- `groupsByDepth(groups)` — topological sort for rendering order, ~line 56
- `resolveIconElems(...)` — iconify resolution with glyph fallback, ~line 325
- `iconGlyph(...)` — built-in line-art glyph, ~line 360

## Learnings — 2026-07-13 Phase 1: architecture Triton connectors

Implemented connector-style parsing/rendering for architecture-beta only. Mermaid arrows remain supported; Triton matrix adds dotted/dashed/thick/wavy directed, undirected, and bidirectional forms. Rendering maps dotted/dashed to dash arrays, thick to 2x stroke width, and wavy through `wavifyPath`; routing/animations/icon placement intentionally deferred.

Validation: `pnpm typecheck` ✓, `pnpm build` ✓, `pnpm vitest run test/architecture-grammar.test.ts test/gridPlacer.test.ts` ✓ (67 tests).

## Learnings — 2026-07-13 Phase 2: architecture connector animations

Implemented architecture-beta connector animation syntax only. Edges now accept `@anim:<name>` and `{ anim: <name> }`, validate against shared `CONNECTOR_ANIMATIONS` plus `none`, and apply poster precedence (`@` wins over `{}`). Layout threads non-`none` animation to `ScenePath.animated`; routing and icon alignment remain untouched.

Validation: `pnpm typecheck` ✓, `pnpm build` ✓, `pnpm vitest run test/architecture-grammar.test.ts test/gridPlacer.test.ts` ✓ (81 tests).

## Learnings — 2026-07-13 Phase 3: architecture connector routing control

Implemented architecture-beta routing-control syntax only. Edges now accept `@route:<straight|orthogonal|bezier|polyline>`, `{ route: <style> }`, and canonical Triton wall hints like `@orthogonal:EW`; `@` annotations win over `{}`. Layout selects the shared router by style and applies `exitWall`/`entryWall` only to RouteRequest directions after directional grid placement. Node placement remains driven solely by L/R/T/B grid semantics. Note: `polylineRouter` currently delegates to straight routing until explicit waypoints are added to RouteRequest.

Validation: `pnpm typecheck` ✓, `pnpm build` ✓, `pnpm vitest run test/architecture-grammar.test.ts test/gridPlacer.test.ts` ✓ (92 tests).

## Learnings — 2026-07-13 Phase 4: architecture icon alignment

Implemented architecture-beta node icon alignment syntax. Services and groups now parse `@iconalign:<N|S|E|W|NE|NW|SE|SW|C>` and `{ iconalign: <dir> }`, with `@` winning over `{}`. Service default remains the previous fixed top-center placement; non-default positions compute compass/badge icon centers and adjust service labels away from side/bottom icons. Group icons render only when `iconAlign` is specified, preserving existing Mermaid/no-annotation output; specified group icons use the same compass placement.

Validation: `pnpm typecheck` ✓, `pnpm build` ✓, `pnpm vitest run test/architecture-grammar.test.ts test/gridPlacer.test.ts` ✓ (123 tests).

## 2026-07-13 — architecture-beta Triton extensions

Implemented four additive architecture-beta extensions in path-scoped commits: connectors (`a033279`), animations (`49eb68d`), routing hints (`460921c`), and icon alignment/group icons (`8dd87dc`). Defaults remain Mermaid-compatible/byte-identical where unspecified; final targeted tests 123/123 green with typecheck and build clean.

## Team Updates (Scribe Session 2026-07-14T19:16:40-04:00)

- Brian added `examples/mermaid/architecture/triton-features.mmd` and rendered `triton-features.svg` as the canonical showcase for Triton architecture-beta extensions: connector matrix styles, connector animations, route/wall hints, and `@iconalign`.
- Verification reported: architecture preview rendered and `test/architecture-grammar.test.ts` passed 100/100.
- Coordinator committed the example artifacts as `fb7a645`; Scribe merged the decision note and wrote orchestration/session logs.


## 2026-07-14 — Group-aware Architecture Placement Implementation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — engine fix committed as `29f875c`; decision merged by Scribe.

Implemented `groupAwareDirectionalGridPlacer(ir)` with recursive clusters, layout wiring, containment-safe align behavior, invariant helpers, and containment/nested/align/repro tests. Validation reported: 936 tests green, typecheck and build clean; out-of-scope showcase `.mmd` edits were reverted before commit.

## 2026-07-14T20:11:53-0400 — Lockout resolved by Edsger

- Brian remained locked out from revising the rejected grouped architecture routing artifact under reviewer-rejection protocol.
- Edsger owned the obstacle-aware routing revision; Ken cycle-3 review passed and coordinator committed the fix as d3258bd.

### 2026-07-14T20:32:44-0400 — Showcase edit scope correction

Brian again over-edited the architecture showcase while implementing per-style wall shorthand: three unrelated edge wall hints were retuned beyond the single authorized demo change. The coordinator reverted the gratuitous edits and kept only `warehouse->dashboard @bezier:EW`. Going forward, Brian must limit showcase/example edits to exactly what the task authorizes; do not opportunistically dodge or retune unrelated edges.

## 2026-07-15T00:54:19-04:00 — Nodegraph skip-edge routing rejection

- Implemented the first nodegraph renderer fix by consuming layered kernel `edgeBends` for skip edges; node overlap cleared.
- Ken rejected the artifact for shared ports, overlapping arrowheads, label collision, and clipped title; Brian is locked out from revising this artifact under reviewer protocol.
- Edsger owned the revision with port fan-out/side lanes/title-aware bounds; Ken approved and the coordinator committed `ef0a043`.
- Learning: clearing overlap is not sufficient for nodegraph routes — incident ports, arrowhead separation, label stacking, and viewBox title bounds must be verified together.

## 2026-07-15T22:50:01-04:00 — Poster Mermaid detection fix

- Poster cells now delegate embedded Mermaid detection to canonical `matchMermaid()` instead of a drifted local keyword list.
- Regression coverage added in `test/poster-mermaid-detect.test.ts` for keywords such as `graph`, `block-beta`, `C4Context`, and `packet-beta`.
- Validation reported: `pnpm test` passed (46 files / 957 tests) and `pnpm typecheck` passed; coordinator committed `0ecb2d2`.
- Scope guard: the unrelated user/showcase edit in `examples/mermaid/architecture/triton-features.mmd` was intentionally left untouched.
