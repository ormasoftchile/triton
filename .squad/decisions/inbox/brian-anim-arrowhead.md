### 2026-07-08: Animated connector dots stop at arrowhead bases
**By:** Brian
**What:** Particle, comet, and stream connector animations now use a renderer-local motion path trimmed by `refX * strokeWidth + dotRadius` for default `markerUnits="strokeWidth"` markers, or `refX + dotRadius` for `markerUnits="userSpaceOnUse"`. The visible connector path and marker geometry remain unchanged; only each `<animateMotion path>` is shortened, with short final segments clamped to a non-inverted remaining segment.
**Why:** The marker's actual back edge is controlled by `refX`, not `markerWidth`. Stopping the dot center by the marker back-offset plus the dot radius makes the dot's leading edge kiss the arrowhead base without a visible gap or overlap.
